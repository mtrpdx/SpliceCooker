============
SpliceCooker
============


    SpliceCooker is a sample library tool designed to connect Splice with the act of making music.


 SpliceCooker reorganizes Splice samples in a way that makes sense.


Roadmap
=======

v1: Copies files into logical structure.
v2: Hashes all files and looks for changes in Splice directory. Can then copy files directly from Splice directory to destination.
